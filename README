This is an android application to send commands and recieve answers to/from The Hardware-set of RR-control project.



*A little intorduction to RR-Control Project

  This project consist of two major hardware boards. The Parent and Childs.
  The parent recieves command from a GSM modem via SMS and after authorizing and analyzing it, sends command to a specific child (mentioned in command).
  This child can do everything that an ATMEGA16 can perfome, just needs some coding in destination.
  After doing the job, the child answers and the Parent forwards the answer to User.
  Now, the job is done. :)
